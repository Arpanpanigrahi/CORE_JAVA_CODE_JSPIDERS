BASICS
------------------------------------------------
1. What is JDK and what components does it include?
- JDK - Java Development Kit.
- Used to build Java program.
- Without JDK we cannot write any Java program.
- javac, JVM, Java API, Development Tools,
Java FX, Other Utilities and JAR.

2. Differentiate between JDK, JRE and JVM.
JDK = JVM + JRE
JVM = Virtual Machine
JRE = RunTime Environment

3. Explain the role of the Java Compiler.
How does it contribute to the Java development process?
-> Compiler compiles the code
--> Syntax Checking
--> Bytecode Conversion
-> Compiler converts source code to byte code
-> Optimize the code
--> Adding additional code (like default constructor)

4. What is bytecode and why it is important in the context 
of Java programming?
Bytecode is platform independent.

5. Discuss the importance of BUILDPATH and CLASSPATH.

6. How does Java achieve "Write Once Run Anywhere" with the
help of JDK and JVM?
- Java applications are called WORA. This means a programmer can develop Java code on onw
system and can expect it to run on any other Java enabled sytem without any edjustment.
This is all possible because of JVM. 
 
7. How can you determine the version of Java installed on a system?
- java -version

8. JAR?
Java Archieve File.

------------------------------------------------------------
DATATYPES
------------------------------------------------------------
9. What are the primitive data types in Java?
byte	(when we are dealing with very small value like data transfer)
short
int
long
float	(float f = 3.6f)
double  (double d = 3.6)
boolean (used to check True or False)
char	(store data in 'A' character)

10. Explain the difference btw primitive data types and 
reference data types.
int a = 90 ---> PDT/ in-built
merchant m = null ---> reference/custom data type

11. What is autoboxing and unboxing in Java?
Bigger to smaller datatype ---> Typecasting

int ----> Integer --> Autoboxing
Integer ----> int ---> Unboxing

12. How is a String object different from other primitive
data types in Java?
String --> Non primitive datatype.

String x = new string("The Kiran Academy");

13. What is the Significance of the 'final' keyword when applied to a variable 
in Java?
--> Final means we can not change.

14. How does the 'instanceof' operator work in Java?
--> It will check whether the referred object belongs 
to that type or not.
- Return boolean value.
- IS-A relationship is mandatory.
- It returns, True if the reffered object belongs to the type,
Otherwise returns False.

15. Discuss the role of 'enum' datatypes in Java?
- The values within an enum are called as constants or enumerators.
- Each constant is implicitly a public, static, final field of 
the enum type.

public enum Days{
	Mon, Tue, Wed, Thur, Fri, Sat, Sun
      }

16. Can you declare a variable without initializing in Java?
--> depends.

-----------------------------------------------------------
if-else
nested if-else

17. Difference btw == operator and .equals() method

equals() --> content ---> string
	 --> address ---> Object class

switch
break

Q} while                         vs       do-while
- First condition is checked,		- First statement are exceuted later it will			
later exceution will be started 	  check the condition.
based on condition. 

- No. of iteration is zero when 	- No. of iteration is one when 
the condition is False.			  the condition is False.


-----------------------------------------------------------
PACKAGE
-----------------------------------------------------------
18. What is Package in Java and how does it contribute to 
code organization?
- Grouping of similar files together.
Ex - Old Songs and New Songs

- Used to group related classes.
- There are two types of packages:-
	1. Built-in Package     - Java API
	2. User-defined Package - Custom Package

19. Explain the significance of package statement in Java?
- package com.thekiranAcademy.custom

20. How do you import a specific class from another package in Java?
-import

21. Diff. btw import statement and package statement.
- import statement - from where to import
- package statement - where you are

22. How does java handles naming conflict?
- By creating package.

------------------------------------------------------------
ACCESS MODIFIERS
------------------------------------------------------------
23. What are access modifiers in Java?
- Access modifiers are used to increase the visibilty and security '
of the member of the class.

There are 4 access modifiers in Java-
- public    (They can be accessed anywhere in the project.)
- private   (only within the same class)
- default   (are accessible within the same package)
- protected (to access IS-A relationship is mandatory)

24. List the access specifiers in Java?
There are 4 access modifiers in Java-
- public    (They can be accessed anywhere in the project.)

- default   (are accessible within the same package)
- protected (to access IS-A relationship is mandatory)

27. Can an interface have access modifiers other than public?
- NO.
---------------------------------------------------------------
CONSTRUCTOR
---------------------------------------------------------------
28. What is a constructor in Java?
- Special method that does not have any return type.
- Constructor name must be same as class name.


- A set of statement that is executed when the object is created is known as constructor.
- used to initialize an object during its creation.
- created by using same class name.
- does not have any return type even void.
- can either initialized by using default or parametrized constructor.
- this is used inside constructor.
- by default for every object only one constructor is created.
- Types:
1. Default Constructor
2. Parametrized Construtor
3. Copy Constructor


- Constructor can be overloaded              - YES, by changing the number of arguments.

- Constructor can be static                  - NO.
- Constructor can be inherited	  	     - NO.

29. How is a constructor different from a method?
- Because method has a return type. 
- And method can have any name.
- Method can be inherited
- Method can be overridden.

30. Can a class have multiple constructors?
- YES.

31. Diff. btw default and parametrized constructor.
- Default Constructor     - which does not have any argument.
- Parametrized Construtor - which have one or more arguments.

32. Can a constructor have a return type?
- NO.

33. How is a constructor invoked in Java?
A a = new A();

34.What happens if you don't provide a constructor in a class?
- Automatically JVM will provide as its class name.

35.Can you have both a default and parametrized constructorin the same class?
- YES.

36. Explain the concept of constructor overloading?
- Constructor overloading is defined as the concept of having
- More than one constructor with different parameters.
- so that every constructor can perform different task.

37. Static block?
- get exceuted when the class is loaded.
- if there is more than one static block it is exceuted in sequential order.
- In static block we can only access static data members.

38. Can a constructor be declared as private?
- YES.

39. What is the significance of making constructor as private?
- No one can create object of that class.
- To achieve singleton design pattern.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
INHERITANCE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
44. What is Inheritance?
- Acquiring the properties from parent class to child class is known as Inheritance.
- It is also known as IS-A relationship.
- The class which is inherited is known as superclass / parent / base class.
- The class which is inheriting is known as subclass / child / derived class.
- static members and constructor do not participate in inheritance.
- Inheritance is unidirectional.
- extends keyword is used.
- Every class can extend maximum or atmost one class.

48. What are the types of Inheritance?
- Types:
1. Single level Inheritance
2. Multi level Inheritance

- To add some feature from parent to child for increasing features.

49. Why can't we use multiple inheritance in Java.
- super()
- diamond problem

- Whenever a subclass wants to inherit the property of two or more classes that have
same method.
- Java compiler can not decide which class method it should inherit.
- Then their might be a chance of memory duplication.
i.e, the reason java does not support multiple inheritance through classes.

50. Can we do inheritance in Java without saying "extends"?
- NO.

51. Can we use a parent class as if it's a child class?
- YES. (Object <---- Parent <---- Child)

52. Do constructors, the private members get passed down in inheritance?
- NO.

53. How can we stop a class from doing inheritance?
-  By making any class as a final.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
SUPER & THIS KEYWORD
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
54. Why do we use "this" keyword in Java?
- represents current class object.
- Yes we can call methods or access a variable.

55. What is "super" in Java and how does it differ from "this"?
- super represents super class object.

- and old memory will get deleted.

58. How do you invoke static method?
- By using a classname.

59. Is it possible to have a static class in Java?
- NO if we are making Outer class as static.
- Answer is YES if we are making Inner class as static.

60. Difference btw static and non-static methods?
- static methods are stored only once.
- but non-static methods will be stored multiple times as many times we are creating object.

- static methods can be called by using classname.
- Non-static method can be called by creating an object of that class.

- From non-static methods we can call static methods directly.
- but from static methods we cannot call non-static methods directly we have to craete object.

61. Can static methods access non-static variables in Java?
- NO. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
FINAL KEYWORD
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
62. What does the final keyword mean?

- whereas for methods we cannot be override it.
- whereas in case of class we cannot extend it.

63. How can you prevent a variable/method/class from being inherited?
- By making it as final.

64. What is a pure constant in Java?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
POLYMORPHISM
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
84. What is Polymorphism.
- An entity showing the behaviour of another entity is known as Polymorphism.
- Can be achieved in two ways:-
1. Compile Time Polymorphism
2. Run Time Polymorphism

85. Why you need polymorphism.
- To behave differently at different instant of time.
- Like mother see is cooking food, taking care, etc.

86. What is method overloading?
- Same method name but different argument.
- No need of inheritance.
- No restrictions for access modifiers.
- No restrictions for Return Type.
